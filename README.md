# StockQuoteApp

This mobile Android app was designed to simplify looking for stocks by providing a quote look-up and stock screener (looks at stocks based on certain parameters. E.g.; >$50 only). In the quote feature, when a user enters a ticker symbol, that quote data is taken from an AWS database, which my friend and I created, and displays this data. This includes basic features such as open/close price, day high/low, and more complex features including news and intraday chart. The screener program (currently in development) would filter out all stocks that we had on the database to locate those that fit a certain criteria, which is inputted by the user. Overall, this app was fun to build with my friend and I hope to do more projects like this in the future. 

APIs used: Quandl, REST
